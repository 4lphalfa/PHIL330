Intro Notes on arguments and Ethics

The long history of ethics: going against the grain
    - The past: modern human beings with our same physical and mental capacities have existed since at least 2000000 years
    - To flourish people developed deeply entrenched habits to collarborate, probably developed rules for living together (morally), and likely reflected on those rules (ethics)
    - Today: the ethnographic record of small groups (eg Amazonians and bushmen-san) confirms that people tend to
        a) cooperate with the forces of their environment
        b) engage in reciprocal collaboration with other human groups, as insurance against environmental calamities
    - Recent Past 11000 years ago the Ice Age ends
    - Beginning 8000 years ago, agriculture develops. People start to congregate in towns ans eventually in cities.
    - Despite the common supposition that in prehistory humans were 'savages' very fiew bones with intentional damage have been found prior to the development of agriculture
    - From 8000 years ago to now, however, plenty of evidence of violence in the record. What happened?
    - Bronze Age walled towns in North Spain
    - New opportunities and challenges: Metal-based agricultural tools and weapons arrive

The long history of ethics: 7th to 6th centuries BCE
    - The Upanishands: possible earliest written ethical reflection
    - Contain the earliest known declaration of Ahimsa (non-violence) as an ethical precept, propose the principles of temperance, self-restraint, truthfulness, charity, non-hypocricy, compassion
    - The writen record showing ethical reflection starts around 500 BCE (2500 years ago), featuring the writings of the Pythagoreands, Empedocles, and Socrates (Greece)...

Morality and Ethics
    - Often the terms 'morality' and 'ethics' are used interchangeably, but we can distinguish their specific meanings
        Morals comes from 'mores', customs and initially has to do with what is customarily seen as appropriate (right/wrong) ways of acting
        Ethics is reflective morality, and has to do with the standards for action resulting from reasoned critique and analysis of morality
    - THe ultimate aim of ethics: to help us live well and to resolve moral problems (possibly through principles and rules)
    - We can assume that all human groups, going far back in pre-history, have had some kind of morality. Why?
    - Because clear rules of right and wrong make life with others easier (they provide and adaptive advantage)
    ...

Some distinctions
    Descriptive vs prescriptive thories of ethics
        * How things are vs how they ought to be
    A common mistake: 'the is - ought fallacy'. To suppose that just because things are a certain way the ought to be so.
        * For instance, even if power often determines how our world is does not meant that power ought to decide: "might does not make right"
    Ethics and law
        * Some illegal acts may not be immoral, and some immoral acts may not be illegal
        * eg in 'apartheid' S. Africa, to marry a 'colored' person was illegal but was it immoral? To lie to and deceive a griend may be immoral but not illegal
    Ethics and Religion
        * Some religeons may call wrong some things that really are not ethicall wrong (religion in Rome required the worship of Ceasar; it was wrong not to do so.
        * Some things that tere is reason to thing of as unethical (eg sexist behavior, slavery, killing innocents) may be not be considered wrong by some religions at some time 
            (eg slavery up to the 19th century)

Diversity of approaches
    - No culture has a monopoly on morality - or ethics, especially not our own European - Western culture
        * in fact some cultures may well greater ethical sensitivity that European cultures
        * for example AMazonian peoples may have more attentive enviroments
        ....

First European philosophes on ethics
    - Socrates denounces the misguided 'education' of his time leading his fellow citizens into unnecessary wars
        * he personally models critical evaluation fo the morality of his time
    - Plato thinks up and writes the first 'utopia' a state in which neither money nore glory-seekers-- nor masculinist would rule
        * he proposes that the right and privilege to rule should go men or women who seek and love wisdom (those who practice philosophia) and not those who simply have 'a good spin'
    - Aristotle described how individuals in society may lead 'a good life'
        * he argues for character development *acquisition of virtues) through appropriate habits of thought feeling and action (virtue of ethics)

First European philosophers on ethics
    - Philosophers from 600 bCS onwards: eg Empedocles, Pythagoras, made some points regarding morality
    - Socrates denounces the misguided 'education' of his times as leading his fellow citizens into unnecessary wars
        * he personally exemplifies gritical evaluation of the morality of his time
    - Plato thinks up and writes of the first 'utopia', a state in which neither money nor glory seekers nor masculinists would rule
        * he proposes that the right and privilege to rule should go men or women who seek and love wisdom (those who practice philosophia) and not those who simply have 'a good spin'
    - Aristotle described how individuals in society may lead 'a good life'
        * he argues for character development (acquisition of virtues) through appropriate habits of thought feeling and action (virtue of ethics)

Aristotelian Virtue Ethics
    - For Aristotle the good life for humans is achieving eudaimonia the flourishihg that humans are capable of ('happiness')
        * Aristotle's theory is not forcused on momentary happiness or pleasure
        * Eudaimonia is the achievement of living well, best seen in a complete life
    - But what is it to live well, for human beings?
        * It depends on the kind of being that we are: our 'function'
    - Foundation of Aristotleian ethics: the human 'function'
        * What is the 'function' of human beings?
    - That which we, as humans, have a unique potential to actualise, the activity humans are specially suited for
        * Aristotle dismisses nourishment, growth, as well as perception (why?)
        * Because plants and animals also exhibit those capacities (so?)
        * As human beings we have special capacity to apply reason (so?)
    - So what is it to live well as a human being?
        * If human beings are a kind of thing that has a function, we can ask whether that function comes in degrees
        * For example, some humans have special functions: musician, juggler, carpenter, and they each can 'realise' their function more or less well because of innate capacities + practice
        * So, does living well come in degrees? If yes, that we can speak ablut the characteristics that enable human beings to live well
    - A good X has the excellences or good characteristics of an X
        * A 'good' knife has the right balance, sharpness of blade, etc
        * Those characteristics ....

Virtue Ethics Continued
    - So to lead a good life, how should one act toward friends and family, towawrd competitors in buisness or the professions, toward one's community or one's country?
        * Virtue is to find 'the mean': to find and act on the appropriate or right measure between extremes for each situation
    - To be virtuous means to act well:
        * In danger, not to be rash nor fearful, but courageous
        * In friendship, not to be a spendthrift nor stingy but appropriately generous
        * In pleasures, not to be glutton nor ascetic, but apprieciative 
    - But there are no rules for finding the mean: it is a call of judgement
        * So a good life requires applying wise judgement throughout life 
        * Both the situation and our personal capacities are relevant (of course in many areas we can increase our capacities through training
        * Practice is the only way to get better at it, just as to be good physical shape requires training.
    - Aristotle's recommendation (instead of a strict principle);
        * Practice the virtues that lead to the best life

Virtue Ethics: Possible problems and possible solutions
    - What if a certain situations calls upon particular virtues that seem in conflict with each other?
    - For example: What if both the virtues of justice and of loyality, for example, seem called for (eg whistleblowing)?
        * What should Edward Snowden have done?
    - Perhaps Aristotle might say that this calls for the development of a further virtue or excellence. Which?
    - Perhaps: A virtue for (ie and excellence in) addressing conflicting judgements with alternatives, sensiblilty, kindness, justice at a conprehensive level. (the virtue of mediation?)
    - ...


Ancient schools of philosphical ethics after Aristotle
    - The schools of philosophy founded after Aristotle tried to describe how to live well despite of the often great difficulties of their times 
        (occupation, slavery, conscription...) and the fear about the after-life, due to religious teachings
    - The Skeptics: we cannot know anything with certainty, neither by way of reason nor by the senses. This skepticism will shield us regarding any dogmatic claims, moral, religious, or otherwise
    - The Epicureans: Our basic desire is to avoid suffering and seek pleasure, so living simply now will help us in times of hardship! (Suffering and pleasure also are ke foci of utilitarianism)
    - The Stoics: Human beings have a nature, and we are able to modify our feelings according to our understanding. SO if missfortune is seen as par of life then we can still live well
