Relationships and ethics, and direction of reflections
    - Ethics concerns relationships that humans are engeged in
    - The professions as well as buisness activity genreate special relationships
    - Professions:
        * between professionals and clients
        * between professionals and society
        * among professionals
        * between professionals and their employers if they are employed at an institution or by a private

Intro Notes on arguments and Ethics

The long history of ethics: going against the grain
    - The past: modern human beings with our same physical and mental capacities have existed since at least 2000000 years
    - To flourish people developed deeply entrenched habits to collarborate, probably developed rules for living together (morally), and likely reflected on those rules (ethics)
    - Today: the ethnographic record of small groups (eg Amazonians and bushmen-san) confirms that people tend to
        a) cooperate with the forces of their environment
        b) engage in reciprocal collaboration with other human groups, as insurance against environmental calamities
    - Recent Past 11000 years ago the Ice Age ends
    - Beginning 8000 years ago, agriculture develops. People start to congregate in towns ans eventually in cities.
    - Despite the common supposition that in prehistory humans were 'savages' very fiew bones with intentional damage have been found prior to the development of agriculture
    - From 8000 years ago to now, however, plenty of evidence of violence in the record. What happened?
    - Bronze Age walled towns in North Spain
    - New opportunities and challenges: Metal-based agricultural tools and weapons arrive

The long history of ethics: 7th to 6th centuries BCE
    - The Upanishands: possible earliest written ethical reflection
    - Contain the earliest known declaration of Ahimsa (non-violence) as an ethical precept, propose the principles of temperance, self-restraint, truthfulness, charity, non-hypocricy, compassion
    - The writen record showing ethical reflection starts around 500 BCE (2500 years ago), featuring the writings of the Pythagoreands, Empedocles, and Socrates (Greece)...

Morality and Ethics
    - Often the terms 'morality' and 'ethics' are used interchangeably, but we can distinguish their specific meanings
        Morals comes from 'mores', customs and initially has to do with what is customarily seen as appropriate (right/wrong) ways of acting
        Ethics is reflective morality, and has to do with the standards for action resulting from reasoned critique and analysis of morality
    - THe ultimate aim of ethics: to help us live well and to resolve moral problems (possibly through principles and rules)
    - We can assume that all human groups, going far back in pre-history, have had some kind of morality. Why?
    - Because clear rules of right and wrong make life with others easier (they provide and adaptive advantage)
    ...

Some distinctions
    Descriptive vs prescriptive thories of ethics
        * How things are vs how they ought to be
    A common mistake: 'the is - ought fallacy'. To suppose that just because things are a certain way the ought to be so.
        * For instance, even if power often determines how our world is does not meant that power ought to decide: "might does not make right"
    Ethics and law
        * Some illegal acts may not be immoral, and some immoral acts may not be illegal
        * eg in 'apartheid' S. Africa, to marry a 'colored' person was illegal but was it immoral? To lie to and deceive a griend may be immoral but not illegal
    Ethics and Religion
        * Some religeons may call wrong some things that really are not ethicall wrong (religion in Rome required the worship of Ceasar; it was wrong not to do so.
        * Some things that tere is reason to thing of as unethical (eg sexist behavior, slavery, killing innocents) may be not be considered wrong by some religions at some time 
            (eg slavery up to the 19th century)

Diversity of approaches
    - No culture has a monopoly on morality - or ethics, especially not our own European - Western culture
        * in fact some cultures may well greater ethical sensitivity that European cultures
        * for example AMazonian peoples may have more attentive enviroments
        ....

First European philosophes on ethics
    - Socrates denounces the misguided 'education' of his time leading his fellow citizens into unnecessary wars
        * he personally models critical evaluation fo the morality of his time
    - Plato thinks up and writes the first 'utopia' a state in which neither money nore glory-seekers-- nor masculinist would rule
        * he proposes that the right and privilege to rule should go men or women who seek and love wisdom (those who practice philosophia) and not those who simply have 'a good spin'
    - Aristotle described how individuals in society may lead 'a good life'
        * he argues for character development *acquisition of virtues) through appropriate habits of thought feeling and action (virtue of ethics)

First European philosophers on ethics
    - Philosophers from 600 bCS onwards: eg Empedocles, Pythagoras, made some points regarding morality
    - Socrates denounces the misguided 'education' of his times as leading his fellow citizens into unnecessary wars
        * he personally exemplifies gritical evaluation of the morality of his time
    - Plato thinks up and writes of the first 'utopia', a state in which neither money nor glory seekers nor masculinists would rule
        * he proposes that the right and privilege to rule should go men or women who seek and love wisdom (those who practice philosophia) and not those who simply have 'a good spin'
    - Aristotle described how individuals in society may lead 'a good life'
        * he argues for character development (acquisition of virtues) through appropriate habits of thought feeling and action (virtue of ethics)

Aristotelian Virtue Ethics
    - For Aristotle the good life for humans is achieving eudaimonia the flourishihg that humans are capable of ('happiness')
        * Aristotle's theory is not forcused on momentary happiness or pleasure
        * Eudaimonia is the achievement of living well, best seen in a complete life
    - But what is it to live well, for human beings?
        * It depends on the kind of being that we are: our 'function'
    - Foundation of Aristotleian ethics: the human 'function'
        * What is the 'function' of human beings?
    - That which we, as humans, have a unique potential to actualise, the activity humans are specially suited for
        * Aristotle dismisses nourishment, growth, as well as perception (why?)
        * Because plants and animals also exhibit those capacities (so?)
        * As human beings we have special capacity to apply reason (so?)
    - So what is it to live well as a human being?
        * If human beings are a kind of thing that has a function, we can ask whether that function comes in degrees
        * For example, some humans have special functions: musician, juggler, carpenter, and they each can 'realise' their function more or less well because of innate capacities + practice
        * So, does living well come in degrees? If yes, that we can speak ablut the characteristics that enable human beings to live well
    - A good X has the excellences or good characteristics of an X
        * A 'good' knife has the right balance, sharpness of blade, etc
        * Those characteristics ....

Virtue Ethics Continued
    - So to lead a good life, how should one act toward friends and family, towawrd competitors in buisness or the professions, toward one's community or one's country?
        * Virtue is to find 'the mean': to find and act on the appropriate or right measure between extremes for each situation
    - To be virtuous means to act well:
        * In danger, not to be rash nor fearful, but courageous
        * In friendship, not to be a spendthrift nor stingy but appropriately generous
        * In pleasures, not to be glutton nor ascetic, but apprieciative 
    - But there are no rules for finding the mean: it is a call of judgement
        * So a good life requires applying wise judgement throughout life 
        * Both the situation and our personal capacities are relevant (of course in many areas we can increase our capacities through training
        * Practice is the only way to get better at it, just as to be good physical shape requires training.
    - Aristotle's recommendation (instead of a strict principle);
        * Practice the virtues that lead to the best life

Virtue Ethics: Possible problems and possible solutions
    - What if a certain situations calls upon particular virtues that seem in conflict with each other?
    - For example: What if both the virtues of justice and of loyality, for example, seem called for (eg whistleblowing)?
        * What should Edward Snowden have done?
    - Perhaps Aristotle might say that this calls for the development of a further virtue or excellence. Which?
    - Perhaps: A virtue for (ie and excellence in) addressing conflicting judgements with alternatives, sensiblilty, kindness, justice at a conprehensive level. (the virtue of mediation?)
    - ...


Ancient schools of philosphical ethics after Aristotle
    - The schools of philosophy founded after Aristotle tried to describe how to live well despite of the often great difficulties of their times 
        (occupation, slavery, conscription...) and the fear about the after-life, due to religious teachings
    - The Skeptics: we cannot know anything with certainty, neither by way of reason nor by the senses. This skepticism will shield us regarding any dogmatic claims, moral, religious, or otherwise
    - The Epicureans: Our basic desire is to avoid suffering and seek pleasure, so living simply now will help us in times of hardship! (Suffering and pleasure also are ke foci of utilitarianism)
    - The Stoics: Human beings have a nature, and we are able to modify our feelings according to our understanding. SO if missfortune is seen as par of life then we can still live well
    - (For more, see Introduction to Ancient Philosphy, Ph 207)

Summary of theories of ethics from the Modern period
    - Countering religious dogmatism in customary morality, three major, revolutionary, approaches stand out
    - Each is bassed on the assumption that ethics should be guided by reason (a capacity all humans have)
    - Social Contractarianism: right and wrong are based on a (fictitious) social contract. Made explicit by Hobbes in the 17th cent. and revisited in the 20th cent by John Rawls
    - Utilitarianism: right and wrong are based on the 'utility' for happiness of the consequences of actions for all those affected. 
        Introduced by Mentham and James Mill (18 cent) and developed by John Stuart Mill (19th cent)
    - The Kantian analysis: right and wrong are basse don whether actions respect fellow humans as capable of pursuing their own goals and life projects (as autonomous beings or persons)

Utilitarianism
    - The foundation: it is relevant to ethics what everyone desires. which is to gain happiness or pleasure and to avoid unhappiness, suffering and pain
        * John Stuart Mill (1806-1873) suggests, moreover, that if we are consistent, we won't privilege ourselves in ethics (Principle of Impartiality!) 
            and the more (and the higher quality) of a good thing the better
    - So the Principle of Utility says: Act so as to bring about the greatest happiness for the greatest number, taking into account that each individual counts for one and only for one
        * Interestingly this approach also implies that the sphere of those who count ethically is greater than the sphere of humanity. Why?
    - Because it includes all those beings that are sentient
    - It is a consequentialist approach: the kind of action is irrelevant, only the consequences count
        * So in some exeptional situations, in which no other course of action seems available, even stealing or lying may not be wrong in this view 
            -- but only if it brings about greater total happiness for the aggregate than all other options

Utilitarianism Applied
    - Missunderstanding: It is not simply a question whether an action brings about more pleasure or happiness than not doing it! (And possibly me!) Why not?
        * This would be a kind of consequentialist ethics but not utilitarian consequenctialist ethics
    - Rather, the utilitarian apporach
        a) is to do the action brings about the greatest amount of pleasure of ahppiness - in comparison to all other (reasonable)  options!
        b) for teh aggregate (the summation) of all those concerned. Relevant: depth in time and space. (How deep?...
    ....
    - Case 1: I have $20 that I want to domate to a worthy cause. I have several options
        a) Give it to a friend who wants to stange a party
        b) Give it to a group of birdwatchers who are collecting donations to finance a trip to S. America to view birds
        c) Give it to Doctor's without Borders to buy bandages and medicine
    - Case 2: On a certain road new Victoria there are many accidents on a narrow curve. The city of Victoria has decided to expropriate the property next toe thad to straighten the road. 
        This will desctroy a heritage house and will force a 79 y/o widdow to move away from her ancestral home.

The Kantian Approach
    - Immanual Kant (1724-1804 CE), worked on epistemology, metaphysics, ethics, many sciences including metorology!
    - Konigsberg, East Prussia (Kaliningrad, Russia)
    - Great Conversationalist, dinner parties
    - Had students seel in hallways trying to get a seat in the over-full classroom in which he taught!
    - The Foundation: Humans value the realisation of their projects. That is: we value our 'autonomy' (capacity of self-direction)
    - Assumes that ordinary people already know what the right thing to do is.
        * Philosophy only helps us to make it clear -- so that we do not (convienently) make exceptions for ourselves
    - Ethics is constituted by what a person guided by reason would do
        * This we can discover on our own: we need to ask, is this an action that I consider ethically right -- without contradicting myself?
        * eg. can I choose to lie -- and really will to live with a world in which lying could be the ethical norm? Or would I simply (and convienently) be wanting to make an exception for myself?

Kantian-2
    - Kant's summary of the ultimate principle: The right thing to do is that, which any rational being can recognise as such 
        It should not intail a logical contradiction nor a contradiction with other reasonable principles
    - From this, Kant concludes that the right thing to do is that kind of act that any ratinal being could 'will' (activity endorse) to be done in the circumstances
    - It is ...
    ...

The Ultimate Principle of Morality
    - So the 1st version of the ultimate principle of morality is: act in such a way that the maxim by which you act could become a universal law
        * Maxums are the underlying principle of actions, that which is guides the action
    - In other words, the 1st version says: act so that you would be willing to endorse that the underlying principle of you action become the principle by which any and all people act
    - Ex1, should I make a lying promise to return something about which I already know that I will not be able to do?
    - Ex2, Should I help someone in need?

Kantian-3
    Three possible types of actions
        1. Sometimes we consider acting in a way that is not in agreement with the ultimate principle (it could not become the universal rule of action). These acts are not permissible
        2. SOmetimes though, we acti because of the ultimate principle, those actions are ethically praiseworthy
        3. Sometimes we act in our own best interests, 
            but if it is in agreement with the ultimate principle (the action does not contradict it) but is not because of the ultimate prinviple then tose actions are permissible 
            (not ethically wrong even if not praiseworthy)
    So
        1. Some actions are clearly wring: to act in such a way that another could not, in principle, consent to. To injure, to defraud, to lie, to manipulate someone...
        2. Some actions clearly are right: to support others in their goals. To gie help to those in need, to return an item that someone lost
        3. Mainly actions are neither wrong, nor praiseworthy: to do what one pleases while respecting others. Ex... painting a landscape picture, walking in the park, minding one's own buisness

Explaining the Principle
    More on the foundation:
        - What is special about human beings is that, as rational beings, we do care about our ability to carry on our projects, to make our own decisions about how to act... we care about our autonomy!
    So the 2nd version of the ultimate principle of morality is this: act in such a way that you always treat humanity as an end and never as a mere means
    Isn't it often necessary to treat others as a means/ Yess, and it's ok
        - The principle says that it is wrong to use others as a mere means: using them in ways that they could not in principle consent to (eg to defraud them)
    - Treating others as ends: suporting them in their attempt to fufill their own ends ...
        ....

Application
    - Ex1, should I make a lying promise to return something which I already know that I will not be able to do?
        Would this be treating another as a mere means or as and end?
    - Ex2, Should I not help someone in need?
        ...

Social Contractarianism: Old and New
    - The Foundation: Agreement is society is the vasis for moral right/wrong
    - Hobbes: Right and wrong is what members of society do agree upon is right and wrong 
            (probably including being against killing innocent children, but also possibly accepting gender discrimination or racism, for ex)
    - Rawls: right and wrong is what each one of us, as members of society, would agree upon if we had to decide 'from behind a veil of ignorance' 
            that impeded us from knowing which place in society each one of us, individually, do occupy.
        * So for example, could gender discrimination or payin ga misery of a wage to someone be right? Well, how ould we think about it if looked at it from behind the veil of ignorance?
    - If we realise that we ourselves might be among the discriminated agains, or those who are paid less than is fair, we will likely not thing that either is fair or right
    - Rawls thinks that we would at least agree to two basic principles:
        1. Each person is to have an equal right to the most extensive basic liberty compatible with a similar liberty for others
        2. Social and economic inequalities are to be arranged so that they are both
            a) reasonably expected to be to everyone's advantage 
            b) attached to positions and offices open to all.
    - Some implications discussed by Rawls:
        * Liberty cannot be traded off for some others benefit: health or other freedom of movement cannot be exchanged for some other benefit to individuals or society 
            -- even if they would increase utility
        * Some inequaities may be acceptable but must be endorsable by all
    
Feminist Ethics
    - The key observation underlying feminist ethics is that women in our societies tend to be subordinate to me, discriminated on the basis of their gender, 
        and that their point of view is either depreciated or not seen as relevant because they are women.
    - Feminist ethics argues that all forms of oppression of women are ethically wrong
    - So: Right action is that which corrects oppression against women, in all circumstance where it occurs
    - Some feminists understand feminist ethics as arising from a commitment to oppose all sorts of oppression, not just of women
    - Consequently they also oppose racism, ageism, discrimination of disabled people, and oppression of nature
    - A key reference point are Karen Warren's arguments for ecofeminism

From Feminist Ethics to Care Ethics
    - A further observation made by some feminists is that women have a specific perspective on life due to their biological and cultural roles
    - The exact nature of this perspective (genetic? cultural?) is debated when it appears to "essentialise" women's biological and cultural circumstances
    - The specific persoective of women has been understood to lead to an ethic of care, which arises from a perception of responsibility regarding those with whom we are in relationships
    - Insofar as this ethics is grounded in personal experience is often contrasted with Kantian and Utilitarina ethics
    - Other rather see it as complementary though.

Care Ethics
    - A key question to ask about ethics: why should I take responsibility? The answer of care ethics is: because I am "in-relationship" with a number of beings
    - The principle of care ethics: "caring for others and fostering good relationships"
    - Foundation: caring for others and fostering good relationships come 'naturally'
        1. beause of our sociality
        2. because of our reciprocal need for each other
    - What is care?
        ....
    - Key Features:
        - Moral attention: attending to the complexity of situations
        - Sympathetic understanding: attending to the best interests of others in need
        - RElationship awareness: taking not that we are all in relationships with others
        - Accommodation and harmony: acting to preserve harmony in relationships by seeking to accommondate others
    - Though originally thought of as characteristic of women and girls, Manning does not see care ethics as limited to one gender
    - A source for the initial development of the theory of care ethics was the supposed contrast between the care and the justice voice
        - The psycologist Lawrence Kohlberg had proposed a theory of stages of moral development
        - Starting from ego-centredness of small children, we develop until reaching the highest stage, at which....

Care Ethics - 2
    - The feminist psychologist Carol Gilligan claims that Kohlberg privileges principles in an abstract moral vacuum, ilustrated by the "Hienz Delema": girls and boys solve it differently
        - The reaction of a) boys in contrast to b) girls highlight different conceptions of agency: 
            a) isolated, following abstract rules, impartiality 
                vs
            b) recognition of our embeddedness in situations, attending to others without rules, with sympathetic understanding and identification
        - Separate vs connected self (Lyons): contrast between a) conflict between abstract...

Buisness and Corporations
    1. What is business? How would you most accurately describe it?
        An enterprise for profit
    2. What makes 'being in business' different from other occupations?
    3. What types of business are there? Four types are prevalent.
        Corporation
        Partnerships
        Sole-provider

What is a business?
    A business: and arrangement of space and time, energy, resources, and people, dedicated to the production or exchange of goods or services, usually for sale and profit
    What types of business are there?
        1. Sole Proprietorships: Owned by one person who retains all of the legal rights and bears all of the responsibilities associated with the business. 
                                 Legally the business is not considered a separate entity from the owner
        2. Partnerships: 2 or more people who agree to pool their finatcial, managerial, and technical resources in order to do a certain activity for profit
        3. Corporation: Legally it is a separate entity that has an independent existence from its owners
            - it can buy, own, and sell property, sue and be sued, and must file its own income tax return
            - Tends to focus on profit, even if other goals are possible
            - Earnings are disbursed based on level of investment
        4. Cooperatives: Legally also a separate entity, usually incorporated
            - Organized, owned, and democratically controlled by the people who produce or use their products and services
            - Earnings are distributed on the basis of participation in the cooerative rather than level of investment
            - The roles of owner and producer or user are closely connected
            - Diverse types: industrial, bankings, farming, housing, shopping, kindergarten, news media, farming, travel agency, etc
    Both corporations and coops
        - profit may be on of their objectives, but not necessarily or exclusively 
        - Either can be are part of the 'social economy'...

Corporations
    1. What makes anything, including humans, 'a person'
    2. What kind of entity are corporations? Are they 'persons' in the same sens as humans --or-- are they persons merely as legal-fictions?
    3. Is the relationship between shareholders and the corporation like that between any owner and her or his property? Are there differences due to the legal independence of corporatins??
    4. Besides the legal-fiduciary responsibilities towards shareholders, corporations may be seen also to have other, ethically relevant responsibilities. On what grounds?
    5. If corporations do have ethically relevant responsibilities. what types of responsibilities specifically do they include?
    6. If corporations were persons, then who is responsible for the effects of their activities (both positive and negative)
    7. If corporations were not persons, then who is responsible for the effects of their activities (both positive and negative)?

Personhood
    What is a person?
    Kantian concept
        - Person has a perspective
        - Agency: persons have goals and act on them based on their beliefs and values
        - Autonomy? Persons strive to be self-directed
    So persons seem to be independent agents who make choices based on goals and objectives and beliefs and values
    Ethical repercussions: to treat persons 'as persons' 
        - Consideration of their interestes as having a perspective, agency, autonomy
        - Expectation of reciprocity, such that persons constitute a moral community
        - Taking (ethical) responsibility for one's actions
    
The Coporation: what kind of thing is it?
    It is defined by its legal status and the ownership of assets
        - Corporations are considered to be 'artificial persons in law': while notionally 'owned' by shareholders, corporations exist independently of them
        - Managers and directors have a legal 'fiduciary' repsonsibility to protect the investment of shareholders. (What does the term 'fiduciary' stand for here?)
    Essential point: corporations exist and have the legal rights of persons because human societies have agreed that they be allowed to exist among us and have those rights
        - The reason they exist in the USA is that country's political leaders thought it important to create a legal framework for the development of the railroads for the conquest of the West
        - The inversotrs were granted the privilege of protecton from liability as individuals because those governing were able to argue that this would be adbantaguous to US american society
    What responsibility do they have?

    And how does his 'principle' apply to corporations?

Diversity of corporate responsibilities
    Some possible corporate responsibilities
        1. Social responsibilities toward the community and society
        2. Towards their employees
        3. Towards their suppliers
        4. Towards their customers
        5. Environmental 
        6. To future generations
        7. Past generations (respecting their requests)
        8. Non human sentient beings
    Diverse areas of the world, i.e. Northern Europe, Africa, USA, Asia, have developed a diversity of de facto approaches to the responsibilities of firms

Diversity of de facto approaches toward corporate responsibilities
    In Norther Europe
        - Umbrella formal agreements were concluded between labour unions and management associations early in the 20th century
            - These agreements guaranteed participation in decision making for workers/employees, in setting conditions for firing and hiring, and in a share of the profits(!)
            - Workers' representatives obtained seats on the board of directors in many Northern European countries (Germany, Sweden)
        - What might be some consequence of these ...
        ...
    In many Asian and African countries
        - companies may be expected to contribute to local communities, either by hiring locally or making significan contrabutions to building projects, education, etc
    In the USA
        - Corporations might 'sponser' community sports events and such (in exchange for free advertising)
            - But it is assumed that the ...

Moral Responsibility of corporations
    Human persons are held morally responsible because
        - They seem to be independent agents who make choices based on goals and objectives and beliefs and values
    But can a corporation be morally responsible for its actions?
        - Can corporations really act independently, based on beliefs and values, or is this merely a convenient fiction?
        - Are corporations rather mere instruments of their owners -- just like machines in industry?

Issues re the moral responsibility of corporations
    Arguments in favour of the view that corporations may be persons and be held morally responsible as persons:
        1. THey have an internal decision structure that directs decisions in line with set goals (French 1979) -- similarly to people with minds
        2. Mission statements manifest a set of beliefs and values that states what is generally regarded as right or wrong for the corporation, creating an 'organizational culture' (Moore 1999)
        3. While ownership may shift, corporations can act based on beliefs, values, and objectives
        4. So by the fact that corporations act based on having an internal decision structure and beliefs and values they should be held equally responsible for their actions as human persons
    Are an internal decision structure + mission statement really sufficient to make something into a person who can act?

Questions re the moral responsibility of corporations
    Are an internal decision structure + mission statement really sufficient to make something into a person who can act?
    1. SInce corporations may exist om paper only, and they cannot suffer as a human being can,, sho the lack of a 'body' be an issue?
    2. Even if corporations were considered persons and held morally fully responsible, should the humands involved also be held morally responsible?
    3. If humans should be held responsible, then which?
        - even if any one of the parties does not seem to be fully involved?

More issues re the morally responsibility of corporations
    Joel Makan (2004): if the corporation is a person then it in fact is kind of unfeeling psychopath, unable to act except in selfish ways, because of the priority of the profit motive 
    Book: Bakan, J. 2004. The Corporation, The Pathological Pursuit of Profit and Power. New York: Free Press 
    Is Bakan right? Is it impossible for corporations to be good 'corporate citizens'?
        - Must corporations necessarily and exclusively be self interested? Why/Why not?
        - What can/should be done to hel them become good 'corporate citizens'?
    Does good corporate citizenship depend on 
        a) its mission statement or -- instead -- of its implicit corporate culture
        b) its formally expressed beliefs and values? or -- instead -- on its tact informally held beliefs and values?
        c) or rather, on the expressed beliefs and values of shareholders (at annual meetings) or of directors of the board?
    If it is a matter of implicit corporate ...

Managerial Capitalism and stockholders
    In the early part of the 20th century, in North America the accepted way of doing buisness was "managerial capitalism" 
        - Accordingly, corporations have all the legal privileges of human persons, such as being able to sue for damages
        - But corporations were supposed to have no responsibilities, except to a limited set of individuals: shareholders or stockholders
        - The basis for this model was a very narrow understanding of the legally binding 'fiduciary' responsibility to stockholders as norminal owners of the corporations
    It may be argued that stock/shareholders are 'at arms length' from corporations, because corporations largely act independently ...

Milton Friedman as spokesperson for managerial capitalism
    Writing in a popular magazine, Milton Friedman (1970) assumes that corporations have no social responsibilities
    His claims:
        1. Only humans have moral responsibilities for their actions 
        2. It is managers' responsibilities soley is to act in the interests of the shareholders
        3. Social issues and problems are the proper buisness of the state rather than of corporate managers
    We may challenge each of his views
        1. Why should only humans have moral responsibilitie? Critique?
        2. Why believe that managers should exclusively act in the interest of shareholders? Critique?
        3. Why should the responsibility for social issues and problems be the responsibility of the state?

Managerial capitalism and ethics
    According the the model of managerial capitalism corporations have very few ethical responsibilities, if any
        - Corporations appear to operate in a 'moral vacuum' -- even where ...

Edward Freeman's stakeholder capitalism -- 1
    Theory developed by Edward Freeman (1984 and 1994 papers)
        - While managerial capitalism supposes that corporations have an exclusive fiduciary duty to stockholders/shareholders...
        - Stakeholders capitalism holds: corporations also have (possibly fiduciary) responsibilities to other stakeholders (1994 p.70)
    Stakeholders of an organization are any groups that have stake in or claim of the firm (1994 p.70)
        - ...any group or individual who can affect, or is affected by, the achievement of the organization...

    ...

Stakeholder capitalism -- 2
    Why?
    The is a reflection of the fact
        - That corporations constitute a part of our society
        - That they depend on corporation from others
        - That they affect the lives and interests of others
    So a stakeholder of a corporation is an individual or group that
        - May be harmed by or benefit from the corporation
        - or whose rights are at risk of being violated...

Stakeholder capitalism -- 3
    Corporations are not natural beings
        - they are deliberate creations of society, benefiting shareholders, tolerated in expectation that they will be useful to society's diverse members
    In this context, business ethics Crane and Matten make the following critical comment regarding managerial capitalist apporaches:
        - "it is not evident why the higly speculative and mostly short-term ...

Stakeholder capitalism -- 4
    Stakeholders are key because they affect or may be affected by the corporation
        - But each stakeholder also has its own stakeholders
    So, an action at one end of a network may filter all the way through to many...

Stakeholder capitalism -- 5
    What could motivate corporations to act more according to the stakeholder capitalist and less according to the managerial capitalist model?
    Possibly
        - Awareness of the CEO, managers and employees of inter-dependencies of the corporation with its stakeholders
        - Clear direction from the shareholders
        - Expectations and encouragement
