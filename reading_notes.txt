Caring as an Ethical Perspective
++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

Caring for other means that one takes concrete actions to look after others.

Care is a virtue

The traditional virtues of courage, honesty, and prudence are all organized under the meta-virtue of care.

There is no universal understanding of need

When we make a promise, we commit ourselves to a certain course of action

An ethic of care doesn't say that you are always commited to keeping a promise because sometimes doing so can be harmful to all concerned, but it does impose a moral obligation to resopnd. 

Moral Attention
    being aware of all the details that will allow a sympathetic response to a situation
    Know all the details that will make a difference in our understanding and response to a situation

Sympathetic Understanding
    Sympathizing and identifying with the persons involved
    Attention to the best interests of others maternalism

Relationship Awareness
    Relationship of fellow creatures
    Relationship of need and ability to fill that need
    Relationship that calls for a specific response
    Preserve and nurture these networks of relationships

Accomidation and Harmony
    Required to try and accomidate the needs of all
    Give everyone a sense of being involved and considered in the process.
    This leads to a better chance of preserving harmony

Appealed to an ethic of care, involving a thorough understanding of the context and a willingness to balance the needs of self and others

Moral development was both cognitive and emotional

The voice of care understands that moral agents:
    embed in certain social contexts, relationships, and personal narratives
    direct their moral attention to real others
    open to sympathetic understanding and identification with those others

Communities and relationships have moral standing and they need to be included in our thought and action
